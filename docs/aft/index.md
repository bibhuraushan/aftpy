The Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model is an advanced representation
of the Surface Flux Transport (SFT) process, which describes the movement
of magnetic flux on the Sun's surface. This model is crucial for understanding
the latter stages of the solar dynamo process, where surface flows transport
magnetic flux from active regions to the Sun’s poles. During this process,
the polar fields from the previous solar cycle are canceled out, and a new
poloidal field of opposite polarity begins to form, setting the stage for
the next solar cycle.

The AFT model stands out by minimizing parameterizations and directly incorporating
observed data on active regions and surface flows. Unlike previous models that relied
on artificial insertion of active regions and simplified flow profiles, the AFT model
uses measured axisymmetric flows and a convective simulation that replicates the spectral
characteristics of the Sun’s convective flows. This method allows for a more realistic
simulation of surface flows, considering the finite lifetimes of convective cells and
their interactions with differential rotation and meridional flow. Additionally, the
AFT model accounts for the dampening effect of strong magnetic fields on convective
velocities, a feature that traditional diffusivity-based models struggle to replicate.

By incorporating magnetic data through manual insertion or direct assimilation
from magnetograms, the AFT model achieves high flexibility and accuracy. Manual insertion,
based on active region databases like NOAA, allows the model to explore flow dynamics
and make predictions, while data assimilation ensures the most accurate synchronic maps
of the Sun. These maps form the Baseline data set, which is essential for evaluating SFT
models and providing source data for models extending into the solar atmosphere and heliosphere.
The AFT model’s approach marks a significant improvement in the realism and accuracy of solar
surface flow simulations.
